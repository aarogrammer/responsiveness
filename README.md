# Responsiveness
Responsiveness is a simple tool to allow you to simply test the responsiveness of your web application.
With a high amount of internet traffic being from smaller devices such as tablets and smartphones, it is important to insure your web application is useable on all devices.
It can be very tedious having to resize your browsers window to check for each resolution, this tool simply allows you to either enter the resolution manually or click the buttons for the screen size you're testing for.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/aarogrammer/responsiveness.git`
2. CD in to the directory `CD responsiveness`
3. Open index.php to use the tool.

## Contributing
1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b branch-name`
3. Add files to staging `git add .`
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Here are my changes'`
5. Push to the branch: `git push origin branch-name`
6. Submit a pull request and I will look at it ASAP.
